# PathsTestStack

This stack displays and self-checks many of the path and page stack-templates. When combined with the test projects it should load and test all of the template and asset types, test that
the templates and assets actually load, and that the API provided paths agree with the paths used in the DOM to load the files.

### Test Projects
In order to test all the conditions of paths, two test files are provide for RW7 and RW8. The projects include pages in all of the major conditions that affect link structure and page hierarchy.

### Test Conditions
To test all possible conditions the "File Links Are:" menu in the Advanced settings should be cycled through all possible conditions in each of the test files and all pages previewed should display a üëç on each line.
